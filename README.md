### **Project Overview**

The Amazon Product Recommender is a machine learning project designed to create a personalized recommendation engine. The system suggests relevant products to users based on their historical reviews and interactions. The goal is to enhance the shopping experience by surfacing products that align with the userâ€™s preferences.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the Amazon Product Reviews Dataset, which contains extensive product metadata and user reviews. It includes over 140 million reviews across 24 product categories, making it ideal for building a comprehensive recommendation system.

- **Access the Dataset:** [Amazon Product Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/amazon-product-reviews)

### **Installation**

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nyashaChiza/amazon-product-recommender.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd amazon-product-recommender
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Usage**

To run the recommendation engine, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the data:**
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
2. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. **Run the API for real-time recommendations:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### **Methodology**

- **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Key features are extracted from the reviews and product metadata.
- **Modeling:** Both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models are implemented to generate recommendations.
- **Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Results**

The recommendation engine successfully provides personalized product recommendations based on user interaction data. It demonstrates a high level of accuracy in predicting products that users are likely to purchase or review positively.
